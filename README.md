# mpv-config
My mpv configuration. Note that this is probably isn't the best.

Setup: 
There is very little to change other than just dragging these files/directories into your mpv directory. However, you must include the following for certain lua scripts/configs to work:

```
scripts/webm.lua: 
Set the filepath for output_directory located in Line 18.
  
mpv.conf: 
Set the filepath for screenshot-directory in Line 70.
```
